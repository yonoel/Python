Goal
In this chapter,

We will understand the concepts behind Harris Corner Detection.
We will see the functions: cv.cornerHarris(), cv.cornerSubPix()

Theory
不多说，有兴趣再查
One early attempt to find these corners was done by Chris Harris & Mike Stephens in their paper A Combined Corner and Edge Detector in 1988, so now it is called Harris Corner Detector.
Then comes the main part. After this, they created a score, basically an equation, which will determine if a window can contain a corner or not.

R=det(M)−k(trace(M))2

where

det(M)=λ1λ2
trace(M)=λ1+λ2
λ1 and λ2 are the eigen values of M

So the values of these eigen values decide whether a region is corner, edge or flat.

When |R| is small, which happens when λ1 and λ2 are small, the region is flat.
When R<0, which happens when λ1>>λ2 or vice versa, the region is edge.
When R is large, which happens when λ1 and λ2 are large and λ1∼λ2, the region is a corner.



Harris Corner Detector in OpenCV：

！！！OpenCV has the function cv.cornerHarris() for this purpose. Its arguments are :

img - Input image, it should be grayscale and float32 type.
blockSize - It is the size of neighbourhood considered for corner detection
ksize - Aperture parameter of Sobel derivative used.
k - Harris detector free parameter in the equation

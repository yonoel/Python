# Goal
+ In this tutorial, you will learn Simple thresholding, Adaptive thresholding, Otsu's thresholding etc.
+ You will learn these functions : cv.threshold, cv.adaptiveThreshold etc.

# Simple Thresholding
 If pixel value is greater than a threshold value, it is assigned one value (may be white), else it is assigned another value (may be black). The function used is cv.threshold.

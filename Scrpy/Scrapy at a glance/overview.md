#Scrapy at a glance
Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data 
which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.

Even though Scrapy was originally designed for web scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs (such as Amazon Associates Web Services) or as a general purpose web crawler.
#Walk-through of an example spider
#What just happened?
When you ran the command scrapy runspider quotes_spider.py, Scrapy looked for a Spider definition inside it and ran it through its crawler engine.

The crawl started by making requests to the URLs defined in the start_urls attribute (in this case, only the URL for quotes in humor category) and called the default callback method parse, passing the response object as an argument. In the parse callback, we loop through the quote elements using a CSS Selector, yield a Python dict with the extracted quote text and author, look for a link to the next page and schedule another request using the same parse method as callback.

Here you notice one of the main advantages about Scrapy: requests are scheduled and processed asynchronously. This means that Scrapy doesnâ€™t need to wait for a request to be finished and processed, it can send another request or do other things in the meantime. This also means that other requests can keep going even if some request fails or an error happens while handling it.

While this enables you to do very fast crawls (sending multiple concurrent requests at the same time, in a fault-tolerant way) Scrapy also gives you control over the politeness of the crawl through a few settings. You can do things like setting a download delay between each request, limiting amount of concurrent requests per domain or per IP, and even using an auto-throttling extension that tries to figure out these automatically.
